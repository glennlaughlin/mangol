TODO: This is a design pattern for publishing static geometry files to the application service.
E.g. publish the current geoJson features associated with the aquaculture lease boundaries. Since these will not 
change through the application, we don't need to store these features in the database. That said, for analytics
within PostGIS (SQL-MM Spatial), we would need the features persisted in the database.
